  <description format="asciidoc">Better web app support for async loggers: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when the logging jars are placed
        in the container's classpath and the configuration file uses AsyncRoot/AsyncLogger.
        The problem was that the first web application started the Disruptor background thread [AsyncLoggerConfig-1] but did not stop it until all web apps are stopped.
        Each web application now has its own Disruptor which is stopped/started together with the web app.</description>
