This is the ninth GA release.
It contains several bugfixes and new features.
The new features include the ability to specify delete actions during file rollover, a CRON-based
triggering policy for file rollover, support for JSR 223 scripts in filters, pattern selectors and delete actions, and a policy for removing idle appenders from the `RoutingAppender`.
More details on the features and bugfixes are itemized below.

Log4j 2.5 requires a minimum of Java 7 to build and run.
Log4j 2.3 was the last release that supported Java 6.

Basic compatibility with Log4j 1.x is provided through the `log4j-1.2-api` component, however it does
not implement some of the very implementation specific classes and methods.
The package names and Maven `groupId` have been changed to `org.apache.logging.log4j` to avoid any conflicts with Log4j 1.x.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
